    <h2>Chapter 1: Getting to Know Me</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      I grew up in a small town where everyone seemed to know each other, and that made it easy to feel connected to the community.
      Over time, I learned to appreciate quiet routines and the value of consistency.
      Those early experiences helped shape how I approach school and work today.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always been curious about how things work, which is one reason I enjoy learning technology.
      When I am stuck on something, I try to break the problem into smaller parts and test each step.
      <span class="sentence">That method has made learning HTML and CSS feel more manageable and enjoyable.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I like activities that help me reset, such as listening to music, going for walks, or working on small personal projects.
      I also enjoy learning new skills online and applying them right away to reinforce what I studied.
      Finding time to practice consistently has been one of my biggest goals this year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Family and friends have been an important part of my life, especially when balancing responsibilities.
      Having supportive people around me makes it easier to stay motivated during busy weeks.
      I am excited to continue building my skills and create cleaner, better-structured web pages as the course progresses.
